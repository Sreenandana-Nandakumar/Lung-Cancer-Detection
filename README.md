# Lung Cancer Detection

This project focuses on detecting lung cancer from a dataset of histopathological images by conducting a comparative study between a custom CNN model and a pre-trained model. The aim is to develop an accurate and reliable system for early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer. By using the ResNet50 model and designing a custom CNN model, the project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of these approaches in accurately detecting lung cancer.
